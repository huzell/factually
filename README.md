Making open data statistics too clear to misunderstand or misuse

The purpose of this project is to create a single place to quickly and easily find open data statistics that are clearly visualized (rather than just linked to).

New open data sources are popping up everywhere but they're scattered and not necessarily focused on being clear for the end user. They might be great for a journalist to find data to confirm the point of an article. But if you the reader are looking to confirm that journalists article you'll most likely give up after a while.

Finding clear and acurate satistics should be as easy as 1 2 3.

1. Go to Seeker
2. Select your subject/source
3. Filter out what you're looking for and flip between various charts for that data
